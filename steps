Create a project folder
In the command prompt npm init
Enter the name and desc, rest can be left as default
You would see a package.json file getting created

Inside the project folder, create a server.js file, copy paste the code

Create two folders public and views under the project folder.

Inside public folder, create 3 new folders. css, img and js. copy paste the basic files. 

Inside views folder create the necessary ejs files. You can add when you actually code the front end.

Inside the project folder, create app folder. Inide that create index.js. copy paste the code

Inside the app folder, create all the basic folders similar to any application and copy paste the index.js code under each of those.

In the command prompt, install all the npm dependencies by looking at the package.json file from a completed app. The command to be used is "npm i <<modulename>>@version --save --exact"

Now we need to login to mongo lab and create a database and a session for that.
